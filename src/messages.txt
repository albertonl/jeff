He's already dead
Stfu
Nice
It doesn't analyze other bots' messages
There you go @BachToTheFuture 😂😂
Yeah which sucks ;(
Yeah

2 echoducks that use the same thing
It ain't fun if it's the same thing
Yey?
Hahah suree
Lol I voted for myself on that poll
same xD
Also does anyone want Sundar's ML model?
Why would we want ML when we have rAnDoM.cHoIcE
Also if () {} else {}
That's exactly what ML is
But a lot of them
who told you to spam
die
sundar will you not do that again?
thanks for replying at least
do you think you're fixed?
Lol I thought that was just a meme
Wait ML is a bunch of if statements + ✨ matrices✨
Nah it is
Basically😂😂
I like more @ImGonnaBeYourWorstNightmareBot 's reply rate

There's one in Bucharest
You can ask Alex how life is there for relocation?
Also there's one in Athens
I'm not sure if it legal to hire 16 y/o in Europe

There's one in Madrid too
And here in Spain it is legal in some jobs
But not in all
And I don't know exactly which
They can not keep records of him?
How Balkans do it
Do projects instead
Bad elon

Yup. I pasted it on the back of a cover which I purchased separately.
We didn't ask Stephanie and everyone got one
Trains in Ukraine arrive on time 😉
He doesn't like me

So ig there was a day on which we talked (spammed) a lot in the previous month
Changed the dates to 3/7 - 2/8 and here it is:

All bots are shit
hacking google....
seems doable
and not insane at all
Good Luck
Which problem is it
I actually have read a post in which he 'hacked' it
He hacked foobar
But not that kinda hacking that you need here
You might get paid
BTW
There's an open source version of Foobar xD
Yeah it's called real life
@dolphingarlic you in a midlife crisis or smt
I hope not
You'll work at Google
Don't get sad lol

Oof
I heard there was a 6 earthquake in California a few days after I left SF
And that's an oof
But that's a huge oof
Andi what languages can you use in foobar?
Java and Python 2
I was in Oakland than
And a few friends called my mom to see if we are alive
i am at my bed and my bed move xd
potential tsunami
Oh no
Hey Andi are you free ?
Shit
I thought python 2 was dead
I remember when we had an earthquake I was asleep
It hit us
And I was like uh?
And went to sleep
Jeff was running on python 2
Until I updated him to 3.7
<3
Jeff you are ded
How did you even think about that in the first place. Shane
Ok ok I'll explain
Alberto also explain that
I just searched for the python idle
And I opened the python 2 one
And then I was lazy to use 3
But then when I deployed it on pythonanywhere I had no other option
Also I f*cked up installing pyTelegramBotAPI with pip so I just used pip3 to update Jeff to python 3
Ok now I seem incredibly dumb
But I installed a wrong version and when I was going to install the right one, pip just decided it wanted to die
@dolphingarlic help?
Lmao you're dead
@MatejMecka I just reported one of j3ff's message as spam. Did you get a notification
Ok so basically try drawing out the first few trees and notice the patterns
No offense✌️
No
Frick u
The first two cases pass😩
So what difference does it make
It's MY bot
You raise it to telegram
Nobody:
Bots: *random GitHub shit*
Can I send you the code
So you can look at it
Ok
Wait so I can just go to foobar.withgoogle.com without an invite link???
Welp you learned your lesson now
No
Send me a link to a The Coding Train video explaining it and then I will have learnt the lesson

@albnl do you know how the apertium-stuff mailing list works?
Frick css
Nop
Apparently I have to ask there to become a mentor but idk how it works
But I'll take a look at it
Do you want to mentor in gci 2019
Yeah
Great!
Not sure if this is what you mean, but I found this:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/apertium/lists/apertium-stuff
Contact - Apertium
http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Contact
I know about that, but how do mailing lists work
Do I just email it?
Uhm
I guess so
Ok
We can ask Ana
Or I can send an email to Mikel, who also works on it
I think
Oh yeah Mikel is the head of apertium lol
Hehehe
Well, whatever you want
I don't mind
I guess I'll just email the mailing list and see what they say
Thanks

Hey @FreddieN @georgeomnet @violinear @echoduck @ByLaws01 @aust_n how did the GCSE go for you?
Good!
What subjects did you do?
Plus from what I read from the Guardian tests are getting harder but so do marks increase too
What's GCSE?
On the Segway ride, we stopped at a garden and had a group photo.
What's the name of that location/garden?
Was it Coit Tower?
I don't think so
There was a church and a statue
Statute of Abraham Lincoln iirc
we never visited that
++
That's the St Peter and Paul church
Washington Square park
Yeah
Thanks @dolphingarlic
Good thanks @MatejMecka
So what's  your plan after GCSE?
GCSE marks the end of high school, right?

Guys what are some words related to bowls?
E.g. plate, crockery, ceramics
Ceramics is a material?
No
Clay is
ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as carbon or silicon, may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and weak in shearing and tensio
Good copy-paste from Wikipedia
Thx
Ceramic material it says
I thought you meant ceramics in general
I know it's a material in Macedonian
But not sure if in English
It is in Spanish
But the thing is that cerámica (Spanish) refers to both ceramic material and ceramics
How many upvotes @albnl ?
Translated definition:
1.Belonging or relating to ceramic material
2. Said of a non-metallic material: manufactured by sintering

How much extra cash did we receive for food?
Nothing strictly for food
From the $400 they said you could use it in anything you'd like
I think they combined it
Travel + Food
Yeah I used it for everything
We forgot we had the Payoneer card xD
Coz for some reason the bank decided to block both credit and debit cards
So we had to use the other one
And they didn't let us unlock it till the 24th or so
Oh yeah they do that
For security reasons
You have to tell them you'd travel outside
Yeah because it was used in Spain
And from nowhere, hotel and car in California
Boy my dad got fucked up multiple times like that xD

You're an Inquisitor
You can judge whoever you want

Ok
I was asking because  , this year they are only providing 200 dollars
The GCI 2019 rules says tgat
We technically got $550 to spend on whatever we like
I bought a GoPro :3
Link?
https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/terms/
It also says "You are responsible for all other expenses, including those in obtaining a passport or visa, if applicable."
But we were paid for Visa fees 👌
:((
Ukraine always was a restricted country
All the time
Except last year
Well not all the time but since the war started
Yeah I think they plan many more winners this year
Nah, only 2
Really?
But if the accepted orgs are more
Then the total goes high
Yep that’s what I mean
Lucky
There's a war in Ukraine? :0
For 5 years already
I didn't know that smh
Poor winners
I bought a Double Double in In n Out
Which is waaaaaay better than a gopro
😋
@sayamkanwar HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
Wish you all the best in life and to be successful
You paid for passport
Why is there no Archive of last years :/
Since when are Mexico, Colmbia, Belarus, Chile, Argentina, Myanmbar And Peru not allowed
Trying to find the old rules be like:
I FOUND THEM
They reverted back to the old sytem
huh
Oof you only have 2 days to submit eligibility proof
You're right they cut 50$ there
It was the same as last year for Visa
Yeah
i saw that Wilhelm Weber :)
no need to delete it
What
You CAN'T SEE ME
But I don't care
Unfortunately we cant win again
Lol that'd be epic
Win twice
Get  a time machine
travel back
win
GG Loophole
But then I couldn't win the 2018 contest
You mean to come back to the trip?
no  no no
You'd know  the past
how it plays out
Hmmm
Interesting
you'll have the knowledge and win
Boom
Big brain
i'm so happy i won GCI this year
Btw can someone help me psychologically
I have to code a robot for school
And I can only do it in Basic
Basic?
Basic, yeah
Oh, if it were that easy...
Well, EV3 Basic
that crap?
Dude it's f*cking stupid
Instead of function it has subprograms
With the keyword Sub
Come on
Just put func or something
Sad
Yeah I was trying to use C or Python but I'd have to format the robot to install a Debian distro in the robot
And I don't think my teacher would approve that
i wanted to try that and a teacher  would have killed me
Yeah
If the robot was mine, I would do it undoubtedly
But it's school's robot
stfu
@MatejMecka and also I have to use Microsoft Small Basic 1.0
Like wtf
You better leave asap
can you shut the fuck up. You're not helpful
Why can't I 3d print my own robot and use something decent like arduino
Raspberry PI :D
Also
Arduino is cheaper tho
Yep
But Raspberry pi is good too
Who the fuck asked you
I already had my passport. And also Google doesn't pay for passports because a passport will be helpful to the participants even after the trip.
It's way better than arduino
++
I even ran chrome for 5 minutes without crashing on it
I have a Raspberry Pi Robot
For shipping, not participation.
Hahahahaha
I had a cluster
:O
