Changed the dates to 3/7 - 2/8 and here it is:

He hacked foobar
But not that kinda hacking that you need here
You might get paid
BTW
There's an open source version of Foobar xD
Yeah it's called real life

I heard there was a 6 earthquake in California a few days after I left SF
And that's an oof
But that's a huge oof
Andi what languages can you use in foobar?
Java and Python 2
I was in Oakland than
And a few friends called my mom to see if we are alive
i am at my bed and my bed move xd
potential tsunami
Oh no
Hey Andi are you free ?
Shit
I thought python 2 was dead
I remember when we had an earthquake I was asleep
It hit us
And I was like uh?
And went to sleep
Jeff was running on python 2
Until I updated him to 3.7
<3
Jeff you are ded
How did you even think about that in the first place. Shane
Ok ok I'll explain
Alberto also explain that
I just searched for the python idle
And I opened the python 2 one
And then I was lazy to use 3
But then when I deployed it on pythonanywhere I had no other option
Also I f*cked up installing pyTelegramBotAPI with pip so I just used pip3 to update Jeff to python 3
Ok now I seem incredibly dumb
But I installed a wrong version and when I was going to install the right one, pip just decided it wanted to die
@dolphingarlic help?
Lmao you're dead
@MatejMecka I just reported one of j3ff's message as spam. Did you get a notification
Ok so basically try drawing out the first few trees and notice the patterns
No offense✌️
No

The first two cases pass😩
So what difference does it make
It's MY bot
You raise it to telegram
Nobody:
Bots: *random GitHub shit*
Can I send you the code
So you can look at it
Ok
Wait so I can just go to foobar.withgoogle.com without an invite link???
Welp you learned your lesson now

@albnl do you know how the apertium-stuff mailing list works?
Frick css
Nop
Apparently I have to ask there to become a mentor but idk how it works
But I'll take a look at it
Do you want to mentor in gci 2019
Yeah
Great!
Not sure if this is what you mean, but I found this:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/apertium/lists/apertium-stuff
Contact - Apertium
http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Contact
I know about that, but how do mailing lists work
Do I just email it?
Uhm
I guess so
Ok
We can ask Ana
Or I can send an email to Mikel, who also works on it
I think
Oh yeah Mikel is the head of apertium lol
Hehehe
Well, whatever you want
I don't mind
I guess I'll just email the mailing list and see what they say
Thanks

Hey @FreddieN @georgeomnet @violinear @echoduck @ByLaws01 @aust_n how did the GCSE go for you?
Good!
What subjects did you do?
Plus from what I read from the Guardian tests are getting harder but so do marks increase too
What's GCSE?
On the Segway ride, we stopped at a garden and had a group photo.
What's the name of that location/garden?
Was it Coit Tower?
I don't think so
There was a church and a statue
Statute of Abraham Lincoln iirc
we never visited that
++
That's the St Peter and Paul church
Washington Square park
Yeah
Thanks @dolphingarlic
Good thanks @MatejMecka
So what's  your plan after GCSE?
GCSE marks the end of high school, right?

Guys what are some words related to bowls?
E.g. plate, crockery, ceramics
Ceramics is a material?
No
Clay is
ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as carbon or silicon, may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and weak in shearing and tensio
Good copy-paste from Wikipedia
Thx
Ceramic material it says
I thought you meant ceramics in general
I know it's a material in Macedonian
But not sure if in English
It is in Spanish
But the thing is that cerámica (Spanish) refers to both ceramic material and ceramics
How many upvotes @albnl ?
Translated definition:
1.Belonging or relating to ceramic material
2. Said of a non-metallic material: manufactured by sintering

How much extra cash did we receive for food?
Nothing strictly for food
From the $400 they said you could use it in anything you'd like
I think they combined it
Travel + Food
Yeah I used it for everything
We forgot we had the Payoneer card xD
Coz for some reason the bank decided to block both credit and debit cards
So we had to use the other one
And they didn't let us unlock it till the 24th or so
Oh yeah they do that
For security reasons
You have to tell them you'd travel outside
Yeah because it was used in Spain
And from nowhere, hotel and car in California
Boy my dad got fucked up multiple times like that xD
Voila

The GCI 2019 rules says tgat
We technically got $550 to spend on whatever we like
I bought a GoPro :3
Link?
https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/terms/
It also says "You are responsible for all other expenses, including those in obtaining a passport or visa, if applicable."
But we were paid for Visa fees 👌
:((
Ukraine always was a restricted country
All the time
Except last year
Well not all the time but since the war started
Yeah I think they plan many more winners this year
Nah, only 2
Really?
But if the accepted orgs are more
Then the total goes high
Yep that’s what I mean
Lucky
There's a war in Ukraine? :0
For 5 years already
I didn't know that smh
Poor winners
I bought a Double Double in In n Out
Which is waaaaaay better than a gopro
😋

        Privacy.
            Google will process the personal information provided during registration and in any subsequent communications to administer the Contest (including verifying eligibility to participate in the Contest, running the program, sending notifications regarding the Contest, and delivering prizes). If a Grand Prize Winner asks us to do so, we will provide a Google referral, or recommendations to schools, employers or other third parties.
            Google will also use aggregated, non-personally identifiable information for statistical purposes.
            The username that contestants create during registration will be displayed publicly on the Contest Website and any archives of the Contest Website, and will be shared with Organizations for the purpose of communicating with the students to answer their questions and reviewing their work. Contestants are strongly advised not to use their real name as username. Parents are responsible for supervising their children’s submissions to the Contest and interactions with Organizations.
            The personal information provided during registration and in any subsequent communications will also be processed by Google’s trusted service providers for the purpose of delivering prizes to winners as well as for booking travel and accommodation for the Grand Prize Winner’s Trip, based on Google’s instructions and in compliance with Google’s Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
            Contestants can access, update, remove and restrict the processing of their personal information in their Contest profile during the Contest Period. If you would like to edit such information after the Contest Period, object to the processing of the information, or export it to another service, or if you’re a parent, you may write to Google (Attention: Open Source Programs Office) at the address listed in Section 1.1 of the Contest Rules or email gci-support@google.com.
            The Privacy Policy (policies.google.com/privacy) further explains how data is handled in this service.How to Submit an Entry Once Registered. To submit an entry to the Contest, you must find, claim, and work on a task provided by an Organization. There is no limit on the number of task entries you may submit; however, there are limitations on the tasks you may claim as described in Section 4.2 below.
        Finding a Task. To find a task, visit the Contest Website. Each task will have a page describing:
            the problem to be solved,
            some general background information,
            the time period for entry submission (“Submission Period”), and
            the requirements that an entry for that task must meet in order to be designated as complete.
        Claiming a Task. To work on a task, you must first claim it by clicking the “Claim this task” button, subject to the following:
            you may only claim one (1) task at a time;
            you may not claim a task that you have already completed; and
            you may not claim more than two (2) tasks labeled as beginner tasks.
        Submitting a Task Entry.
            The Submission Period begins when you claim the task. You must submit your task entry to the Contest within the Submission Period; otherwise, the task will be released for other contestants to claim. You will receive an email warning twenty-four (24) hours prior to expiration of the Submission Period.
            You should review the description for the task carefully before submitting an entry. Each task may require different information to be submitted to be considered complete. Your entry must be in English unless otherwise specified in the task description. You may submit your entry on the Contest Website by either:
                uploading your original work product as an attachment, or
                providing a URL to your work.
    Judging. The Organization that provided the task will judge all entries for that task.
        Judging Task Entries.
            Each complete task entry is worth one (1) point.
            The Organization that provided the task will determine if an entry satisfies the requirements stated on the task page and is complete.
            Your entry will be considered incomplete if the entry is not properly licensed by you under the open source license specified by the Organization that provided the task, or if one is not specified by them, then
                for any software included in the entry, under an Open Source Initiative approved license of your choice; or
                for anything else (not software) under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.
            If you want to challenge an Organization’s determination that your entry was incomplete, you must contact Google using the email link provided on the Contest Website within 5 business days. Google will then re-examine the entry and make a final determination as to whether the entry was complete. Google’s decision in this matter is final and binding.
        Selecting Finalists and Grand Prize Winners. Each Organization will evaluate the work of the twenty (20) highest scoring contestants who completed tasks for their Organization and will select six (6) of those contestants as Finalists and two (2) of those Finalists as Grand Prize Winners for their Organization. Each entry will be judged according to the following factors: creativity, thoroughness, and quality of work. The Organization may additionally factor the contestant’s involvement in the Organization’s community in the judging. The Organization’s decision is final and binding.
            Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, if a contestant was selected as a Grand Prize Winner in any previous Google Code-in Contest, such contestant is ineligible to be selected as a Grand Prize Winner for this Contest.
            If two (2) or more Organizations choose the same Grand Prize Winner, then the Grand Prize Winner will be named by the Organization that submitted the name to Google first. The other Organization(s) will then name their runner up as their Grand Prize Winner.
Finalists and Grand Prize Winners will be initially notified by email by December 29, 2018. Such contestants must upload proof of enrollment in a pre-university program to their Contest profiles within four (4) days of such notification and respond to any other requests for information within seven (7) calendar days of such notification or earlier if required by law.
            In the event a Grand Prize Winner is disqualified for any reason, the runner up selected by the Organization will be chosen as the Grand Prize Winner.
            The official list of Grand Prize Winners and Finalists will be posted on the Contest Website on or before January 7, 2019 for a period of at least sixty (60) days.
    Prizes.
        No Completed Entries. In the event that no completed entries are received, no prizes will be awarded.
        Prizes for Completed Entries.
            You are eligible to receive one (1) digital certificate of completion with an approximate value of $0 USD if you submit at least one (1) complete entry.
            In addition to the digital certificate, you are eligible to receive one (1) t-shirt with an approximate value of $12 USD if you submit three (3) or more complete entries
        Prizes for Finalists. In addition to the prizes listed in Section 6.2 above, if you are selected as a Finalist, you are eligible to receive one (1) hooded sweatshirt with an approximate value of $35 USD.
        Prizes for Grand Prize Winners. If you are selected as a Grand Prize Winner, you are eligible to attend a Grand Prize Winner’s Trip to Google’s Headquarters in Mountain View, California, USA for you and one (1) parent or legal guardian. The prize consists of round-trip coach air transportation for you and your parent or legal guardian from the major airport nearest to your residence, ground transportation to and from the airport and the event location, hotel accommodations for two (2) people for four (4) nights, and catered meals during the event plus an additional $250 USD for food. Google will schedule the dates of the event, which can not be changed. Google will directly arrange the hotel accommodations at a hotel of Google’s choice. You are responsible for all other expenses, including those in obtaining a passport or visa, if applicable. You may not change the travel schedule once it has been arranged. You must have all of your required travel documents (valid passport and visa, if applicable) at least 30 calendar days before the first day of the Grand Prize Winner’s Trip for travel to be booked. Prior to ticketing:
            Your parent or legal guardian accompanying you must sign the Parental Consent; and
            Both of you must possess required travel documents (e.g., valid passport and visa, if applicable) at least 30 days before the first day of the Grand Prize Winner’s Trip for travel to be booked. Failure to secure a passport or required visa 30 days prior to the first day of the Grand Prize Winner’s Trip will result in forfeiture of the Grand Prize Trip prize.
        Substitute Prizes. Google may provide a substitute prize of equal or greater value at Google’s discretion, or where required by law, or in the event all or part of a prize becomes unavailable. If you are unable to attend the Grand Prize Winner’s Trip due to required National School Exams or are unable to obtain a passport or visa by the deadline described in 6.4, Google may award an alternate prize valued up to $2,000.
        Taxes.
            You are solely responsible for complying with all applicable tax laws and filing requirements. To remain eligible for a prize, you must submit to Google or the relevant tax authority all documentation requested by Google or required by applicable law within seven (7) days of Google’s request or earlier if required by law.
            You are solely responsible for paying all taxes imposed on prizes awarded to you. All prizes will be net of any taxes Google is required by law to withhold.
No Warranties. Except as required by law, Google makes no warranties, express or implied, for prizes.
        Forfeiture.
            You will forfeit your prize(s) if:
                Your prize or prize notification is returned to Google;
                You provide an incorrect or incomplete shipping address;
                You do not submit your shipping details and tshirt size selection to the third-party vendor by the deadline listed in the prize emails sent at the end of the Contest;
                You fail to provide Google with information requested (e.g., adequate proof of enrollment in a pre-university program, etc.) within the required time frames;
                You fail to pay applicable taxes or timely submit applicable documentation to Google or the relevant tax authority; or
                If you are a Grand Prize Winner, your parent or legal guardian accompanying you on the Grand Prize Winner’s trip fails to return the signed Parental Consent within seven (7) days of Google’s request.
                You are or become an Ineligible Individual or are disqualified at any point during the Contest.
            If you forfeit your prize as a Grand Prize Winner, an alternate Grand Prize Winner may be selecte

They reverted back to the old sytem

Oof you only have 2 days to submit eligibility proof
You're right they cut 50$ there
It was the same as last year for Visa
Yeah

Unfortunately we cant win again
Lol that'd be epic
Win twice
Get  a time machine

GG Loophole
But then I couldn't win the 2018 contest
You mean to come back to the trip?
no  no no
You'd know  the past
how it plays out
Hmmm
Interesting
you'll have the knowledge and win
Boom
Big brain
i'm so happy i won GCI this year
Btw can someone help me psychologically
I have to code a robot for school
And I can only do it in Basic
Basic?
Basic, yeah
Oh, if it were that easy...
Well, EV3 Basic
that crap?
Dude it's f*cking stupid
Instead of function it has subprograms
With the keyword Sub
Come on
Just put func or something
Sad
Yeah I was trying to use C or Python but I'd have to format the robot to install a Debian distro in the robot
And I don't think my teacher would approve that
i wanted to try that and a teacher  would have killed me
Yeah
If the robot was mine, I would do it undoubtedly
But it's school's robot
stfu
@MatejMecka and also I have to use Microsoft Small Basic 1.0
Like wtf
You better leave asap
can you shut the fuck up. You're not helpful
Why can't I 3d print my own robot and use something decent like arduino
Raspberry PI :D
Also
Arduino is cheaper tho
Yep
But Raspberry pi is good too
Who the fuck asked you
I already had my passport. And also Google doesn't pay for passports because a passport will be helpful to the participants even after the trip.
It's way better than arduino
++
I even ran chrome for 5 minutes without crashing on it
I have a Raspberry Pi Robot
For shipping, not participation.
Hahahahaha
I had a cluster
:O
But the raspi 2 went oof
And I removed it
Now I have a buggy Ubuntu on it
And a pretty decent raspbian on the raspi 3B
No it means the same thing. Less than 18 years = 17 years. No more than 17 years = 17 years.
Nope
i couldn't find it in the old rules
There were 4 finalists in 2018 :0
But I think I'd noticed it while working
i can send you the diff
https://www.diffchecker.com/EE1Rz8u1
Instead of using a f*cking wheel
Sad lol
Rip xD
Nah thanks
What I meant is that I'd noticed some tasks being removed
I wanted to work on them but when I was ready I couldn't find them
Either the mentors removed those tasks
Or
This happened
