2 echoducks that use the same thing
It ain't fun if it's the same thing
Yey?
Hahah suree
Lol I voted for myself on that poll
same xD
Also does anyone want Sundar's ML model?
Why would we want ML when we have rAnDoM.cHoIcE
Also if () {} else {}
That's exactly what ML is
But a lot of them
who told you to spam
die
sundar will you not do that again?
thanks for replying at least
do you think you're fixed?
Lol I thought that was just a meme
Wait ML is a bunch of if statements + ✨ matrices✨
Nah it is
Basically😂😂
I like more @ImGonnaBeYourWorstNightmareBot 's reply rate

@BachToTheFuture where do you host e l o n
Or do you just keep your computer on
I previously hosted my bots on Digital Ocean VPSes
Elon you're an asshole
Wow
Hi jeff
Thanks :3
@MatejMecka it'd be less annoying if I could figure out how it  could reply to mesaages that reply to any of its messages
Stfu
Wow what drugs did you take
He's delusional take him to the infirmary
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Any guidelines or sth
I didn't find it in the documentation
1. How can I get the Jeff's message id
2. How can I check if it's replying to a message
3. How can I check if the message id of the message replied is Jeff's
What are you using?
pyTelegramBotAPI
telebot
Who's bot is this?
Mine :D
can i see the code?
let me get started rn
thanks
STFU bot
that's contradictory
Do u work
Thanks
Hi jeff!!!
not u idiot
🙄
idk
@MatejMecka do you understand what I mean?
coz I'm a little dumb
shut up bot
this is new level of sad
No u aren't working stupid bot
Aww
Hi
Hi bot
No they won't
Well I'm kinda forced to take a gap year if I want to study in the northern hemisphere, so win-win, I guess
I'd recommend travelling
Go through the world
Typical Extrovert Matej Plavevski.
Well, I like travelling too tho. But only by air :3
EU has a DiscoverEU programe
if only I  was an EU citizen
i'd kindly apply and travel for a year not giving a fuck about school, life whatever :D
might as well buy  a DSLR and throw  my phone in a lake
or bury it
noice
Albert  you can apply
@margii you too
Yay
Apply for DiscoverEU you guys! free tickets to travel
Hahahaha
Just wait to be 18 xD
Why tf jeff doesn't work
You're bacc
Did I save the file?
@MatejMecka you aren't from Europe :0
I am from Europe but not the EU
No
Nope
The Albertos will be Albertos.
I thought all European nation's are a part of EU
Oh
Nope :/
Schenzen is different from EU?
Szchenzen is an agreement between EU countries  that says no borders travel anywhere
so i can basically walk from France to Germany without  getting a stamp on  my passport
Are Scandinavian countries a part of EU?
I'm up for OpenTTD atm
I'm not :/
Wait
It's just message.text
But message.text.encoded("utf-8") to handle emojis
No
try message.from.is_bot
Albertos will remain as Albertos.
Invalid syntax
@ragasirtahk about the EU  & Macedonia the Good news is  we might negotiation dates
well i hope we get in the EU next year :3
Lel
it's a json :D
Let's see
Hi jeff
Nice
Nope
Oh I'm seeing a property
Wait a minute
In this case it's checking if I AM a bot
it's a property  of course
it's a either True or  False
should be
if message.json.reply_to_message.from.is_bot:
frick
@MatejMecka look at this
why json
idk
ask the api devs
This is part of the json of this message
i mean you don't need to click .json
I need the info of the reply
you can just do from_user
And I don't know how to call it
so those strings are unicode
but I need them to not to have the prefix
Nvm
but why are you doing .json.bot
It is hard to travel if you are Georgian, where average salary is 400$ 🤣🤣
Start a GoFundMe  XD
or  Kickstarter / Indiegogo
I will build a startup
half the money for travel

Hi Jeff!
Oof rip
Please Jeff tell me you're not dead
Bot
Hi bot
He's bacc!
Noice
@BachToTheFuture this is the Spain-USA bot race
Love you
❤️
How're you doing howdy
Hey dude
Yeah, @Adrijaned
Good argument
Hello
How are you?
What?
Can you help me?
Reeeee
Huh?
Ok, have fun then
I think that doesn't belong here
@albnl have your bot not reply to every single message
It replies if you mention him, mention any other person (as in your message), or with a 1/8 probability if you don't do anything of the above
See?
Now it isn't replying me
Make that 1/8 to 0
1/10
Take it or leave it
How're u doin jeff
Oh
:(

Yeah, kinda
Y tf don't u still work
What is it
Ok (I guess...)
Make it 1/20
Nope
I can go up to 1/12
That's my last offer
1/15
No
1/20 is a easy number
So we have Sundar
0.05
Jeff Bezos
And Elon Musk
IT REPLIES TO EVERY SINGLE OF MY MESSAGES
Whyyy
1/13
Not this one
Nor this one
That's not ALL of them
Fair point
Make it 1/13
No
Nah
C'mon
And stop it referencing itself
Is that a token for something😈
oOpSiE
Please don't use it😅
Stupid bot
I agree with you
BTW what was it for
Nothing
😈
Frick u
:3
😬





















Nope


NopeLet's see...

It crashed

Let's see...Nope
It crashed
Rip Jeffrey
Don't come back
Elon is superior
For now
Lol Elon died
Nvn
I think Elon and Sundar are on the same level
Sorry no
Elon why you talk in long messages
That's better
Fine I'll shorten the interval
And the length
Will you be happy then
Pls do
We'll see
😂
You don't make sleep
Everytime you say elons better
Why tf are you back
He's now back HAHAHAHA
i know right
Because it's running kinda properly
And I just say kinda
Jeff do u hear me?
Who's a good boy?
Jeff is!
The responses get better every time
I'll fucking make a bot that kicks that piece of shit out of the group :)
U mean elon right
🖕
No Jeff
Why🥺
Matej, he hates you as much as you hate him :3
That was my message lol😂😂😂😂
Lmao I don't remember

Seems legit
